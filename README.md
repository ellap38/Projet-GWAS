# Projet-GWAS
mvp.R : This script will be able to run our GWAS with the mvp tool (A memory-efficient, visualize-enhanced, parallel-accelerated Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) tool) with the phenotypic data and genotypic data in VCF, Plink binary, HapMap,numeric, Kinship or PCA. This software will automatically outputs high-quality figures as well has the GWAS results.

GAPIT.R :This script use the GAPIT tool which implemented a series of methods for Genome Wide Association (GWAS) and Genomic Selection(GS). The GWAS models include General Linear Model (GLM), Mixed Linear Model (MLM or Q+K),Compressed MLM (CMLM), Enriched CMLM, SUPPER, Multiple Loci Mixed Model (MLMM),FarmCPU and BLINK. The GS models include gBLUP, Compressed BLUP, and SUPER BLUP.
